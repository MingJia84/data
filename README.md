# Data Description

This study is based on a real-world liner shipping alliance and focuses on 13 Asia–Europe service routes, and each route is operated by vessels deployed by 2 to 4 shipping companies. The dataset in this paper includes origin–destination (OD) demand and freight rate information, collected from publicly available sources ([LINERLIB](https://github.com/blof/LINERLIB)), personal projects with shipping companies, and synthetically generated data.

The dataset is organized into four main components:
1. The liner service network (available in [https://lines.coscoshipping.com/](https://lines.coscoshipping.com/));
2. Port information;
3. OD demand data for companies A-D;
4. OD freight rate for companies A-D.
